Please note: in this pseudocode, "Player_", "Minion_", and "Wumpus_" are the names of instances of the Player, Minion, and Wumpus classes. A single Player instance and Wumpus instance should be stored by GameControl, and a list of Minion instances should also be stored.

Player_.addTurn();
Player_.updateScore();

for(each Minion_ in Minions)
{
	Minion_.addTurn();
	Minion_.updateScore();
}

Wumpus_.addTurn();
Wumpus_.updateState();
